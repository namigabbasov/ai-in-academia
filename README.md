# Survey Instrument: Participant Version

## Overview
This repository contains the survey instrument used in two experimental studies exploring participant attitudes, reasoning, and perceptions related to Artificial Intelligence in educational and social contexts.

Instrument is designed to measure:
- AI literacy and understanding of generative AI systems  
- Technology acceptance in educational settings  
- Belief updating and motivated reasoning in response to AI-generated explanations
  
Once analysis is complete, replication code and analytical scripts will be added to the `analysis/` directory to allow full replication of study results.
